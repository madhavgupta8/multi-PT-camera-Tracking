# multi-PT-camera-Tracking

## Abstract

Asymmetrical tracking by two camera sensors can be used in various applications.
Its widest application would be in production in sports or any other media where an
object can be tracked from two angles without the need of a human input. This report
briefly explains the various methods that are used to achieve this objective. States of
the sensor and its field of view are explained in detail. This tells us about the how the
field of view is defined for a pinhole camera sensor. The target detection method is also
defined in this report. Target tracking has also been introduced where a Proportional
Integral controller is used to track the target. Moreover, the concept of leading and
lagging sensor is defined in the report on the basis of which the tracking cases are
defined.
